# AngularTourOfHeroes

This is my first public Angular project. Before this, I've also coded along with Angular's official documentation for the projects "Getting Started with Angular" and "Angular Homes". These projects have helped me a lot to learn about various Angualr concepts including components, property binding, routing, services, pipes, TypeScript, and more.
